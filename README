OpenCatan is a project to build Yet Another Catan codebase.

I'm mostly using this as an excuse to hone my Ruby skills, and the hope is to be able to get this working in the browser itself.

Yes, that means without using Flash or Java Applets as the main medium of display.

Whee.

Design Goals
* Arbitrary map designs
** Serializable
* 2-10 players
* API hooks for AI design
* Canvas-based rendering engine
** Client agnostic

Significant Codebases, in order of priority
* Catan in Ruby library
** Serialization language for maps
* Canvas-based hex-map renderer in Javascript.
* Rails-Juggernaut chat server, with a Catan protocol piggybacking.
* A play interface, including Dashboard and Trade.
